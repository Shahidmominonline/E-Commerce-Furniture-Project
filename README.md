# E-Commerce Furniture Sales Analysis & Predictive Modeling
🔍 **Project Overview**
This project analyzes an e-commerce furniture sales dataset to identify key factors influencing sales volume. Using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, we explore pricing trends, shipping preferences, and build predictive models to forecast sales performance.

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
🔨 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

🔨 Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Model Evaluation)

🔨 Jupyter Notebook (Interactive Analysis)

📂 **Key Features**
🚩 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized price distributions, shipping preferences, and sales trends.

🚩 Feature Importance – Identified price (80%) and shipping method (20%) as top influencers.

🚩 Predictive Modeling – Tested Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict sales (with performance insights).

🚩 Actionable Insights – Recommendations for pricing optimization and shipping strategies.

📈 **Key Findings**
📌 Price Sensitivity: Negative correlation between price and sales volume.

📌 Shipping Impact: Free shipping increases conversions but is secondary to pricing.

📌 Model Limitations: Current features explain only 1.4% of sales variance (low R²), indicating a need for more data.
